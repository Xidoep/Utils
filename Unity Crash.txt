When unity crashes.

1.- Before open your project...

2.- Go to "UnityProject"/Temp/_Backupscenes.

3.- Then find the most resent file like: 0.backup

    This is a backup of your scene.

4.- Rename it to something like this: myBackupSceneThatCrashed.unity

5.- Bring it back to your asset's folder.

6.- After that, open your project and open your this scene, to recover the scene as it was before the crash.
